This repo is for my first recitation assignment in web- ATLS 2200. I love to surf, snowboard, freedive, and skateboard, and I am passionate about freelance photography and videography. The past two summers I've been a surf insturctor in Long Beach Island, New Jersey. On top of that, I also did an internship in Cape Town, South Africa this past summer- which is where I would like to move to once I graduate. My favorite movies are Interstellar, Blue Crush 2, and Surfs Up.
