        <li> One of my goals this semester for web is to become more comfortable
            with using HTML on a daily basis </li>
        <li> Another goal of mine this semester is to reconfigure my portfolio
            website using HTML as the software I currently use for it is very amatuer</lI>
        <li> Lastly, my final goal is to add creating websites using HTML to my toolbox
            of things I have to offer in my career of design </li>

        I love to skateboard, surf, and snowboard. I am very passionate about pursuing
        freelance photography and videography. Some of my favorite places I like to travel
        to are the North Shore of Oahu, Cape Town, South Africa, and Western Canada. Some
        places I will travel to once I graduate are the Philippines, Bali, Indonesia, Berlin,
        Germany, and Alaska. My favorite things to paint are myself and lava lamps.
