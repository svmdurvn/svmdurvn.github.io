        <li>One of my goals this semester for web is to become more comfortable with using HTML on a daily basis</li>
        <li>Another goal of mine this semester is to reconfigure my portfolio website using HTML as the software I currently use for it is very amateur</li>
        <li>Lastly, my final goal is to add creating websites using HTML to my toolbox of things I have to offer in my career of design</li>
    </ul>

        I love to skateboard, surf, and snowboard. I am very passionate about pursuing freelance photography and videography. Some of my favorite places I like to travel to are the North Shore of Oahu, Cape Town, South Africa, and Western Canada. Some places I will travel to once I graduate are the Philippines, Bali, Indonesia, Berlin, Germany, and Alaska. My favorite things to paint are myself and lava lamps.
