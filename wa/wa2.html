        I love to skateboard, surf, and snowboard. I am very passionate about pursuing
        freelance photography and videography. Some of my favorite places I like to travel
        to are the North Shore of Oahu, Cape Town, South Africa, and Western Canada. Some
        places I will travel to once I graduate are the Phillipines, Bali, Indonesia, Berlin,
        Germany, and Alaska. My favorite things to paint are myself and lava lamps.
